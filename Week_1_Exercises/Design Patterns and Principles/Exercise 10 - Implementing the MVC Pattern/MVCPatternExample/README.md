# MVCPatternExample

This project demonstrates the MVC Pattern in Java for managing student records.

## Steps to Implement

2. Create a `StudentView` class (View) with a method `displayStudentDetails()`.
3. Implement a `StudentController` class (Controller) that communicates between the Model and the View.
4. Test the MVC implementation.

## How to Run
1. Compile the project using `javac Student.java StudentView.java StudentController.java MVCPatternExample.java`.
2. Run the main class `MVCPatternExample` to demonstrate the MVC pattern.
