# SingletonPatternExample

This project demonstrates the Singleton Pattern in Java by ensuring that a `Logger` class has only one instance throughout the application lifecycle.

## Steps to Implement
1. Create a Singleton class `Logger` with a private static instance of itself.
2. Ensure the constructor of `Logger` is private.
3. Provide a public static method to get the instance of the `Logger` class.

## How to Run
1. Compile the project using `javac Logger.java SingletonPatternExample.java LoggerTest.java`.
2. Run the test class `LoggerTest` to verify the Singleton implementation.
